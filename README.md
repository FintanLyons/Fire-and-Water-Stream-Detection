# Fire-and-Water-Stream-Detection
Develop fire and water stream video recognition software which can be used to effectively aim and shoot a fire with a water stream

Within the folder Fire Detection, python code details a simple method of detecting a fire using both a rgb and thermal camera

Within the folder Water Stream Detection, python code details how to detect a water stream

Within the folder Combined Code, both sets of code were combined, a PID controller was added and the code was converted to work in real time with a Raspberry Pi, a water pump and gimble.
